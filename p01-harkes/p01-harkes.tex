\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This artifact is based on {\tt IceDust2}, a data modeling language with derived values.
  The provided package is designed to support the claims of the companion paper: in particular, it allows users to compile and run IceDust2 specifications.
  Instructions for building the IceDust2 compiler from source in Spoofax are also provided.
\end{abstract}

% ARTIFACT: please stick to the structure of 7 sections provided below

% ARTIFACT: section on the scope of the artifact (what claims of the paper are intended to be backed by this artifact?)
\begin{scope}
  The provided package is designed to support the following claims of the companion paper:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item IceDust2 has two working back ends.
    \item We did two case studies.
  \end{itemize}  
\end{scope}

% ARTIFACT: section on the contents of the artifact (code, data, etc.)
\begin{content}
  The archive contains the following file and folders:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A description on how to build the IceDust2 compiler and how to comiple IceDust2 files.
  \item The source files for the IceDust compiler, a test suite, and IceDust example programs.
  \item The language workbench Spoofax (in Eclipse) in which IceDust is developed. The folder contains a Linux, Windows and MacOS version.
  \item The WebDSL compiler (also in Eclipse), which IceDust compiles to for persistence and concurrency. The folder contains a Linux, Windows and MacOS version.
  \item Two empty folders, suggested to use as workspace for Spoofax and WebDSL.
  \end{itemize}
\end{content} 

% ARTIFACT: section containing links to sites holding the
% latest version of the code/data, if any
\begin{getting}
% leave empty if the artifact is only available on the DROPS server.
% otherwise, provide links to the latest version of the artifact (e.g., on github)
  The latest version of our code is available on GitHub: {\url {https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/IceDust}}.
\end{getting} 

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the platforms on which the artifact is known to
% work, including requirements beyond the operating system such as large
% amounts of memory or many processor cores
\begin{platforms}
  The artifact is known to work on macOS Sierra and Windows 10 with at least 5~GB of free
  space on disk and at least 4~GB of free space in RAM.
  JDK 8 or newer needs to be available on your path. (Both {\tt java} and {\tt javac} should be available in the terminal.)
\end{platforms}
