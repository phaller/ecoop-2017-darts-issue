\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This artefact demonstrates the effects of the serialisation vulnerabilities described in the companion paper. It is composed of three components: scripts, including source code, for Java, Ruby and C\# serialisation-vulnerabilities, two case studies that demonstrate attacks based on the vulnerabilities, and a contracts-based mitigation strategy for serialisation-based attacks on Java applications. The artefact allows users to witness how the serialisation-based vulnerabilities result in behavior that can be used in security attacks. It also supports the repeatability of the case study experiments and the benchmark for the mitigation measures proposed in the paper. Instructions for running the tasks are provided along with a description of the artefact setup.
  \end{abstract}

% ARTEFACT: please stick to the structure of 7 sections provided below

% ARTEFACT: section on the scope of the artefact (what claims of the paper are intended to be backed by this artefact?)
\begin{scope}
  The artefact is designed to support repeatability of the experiments of the companion paper. It has scripts, including sources, for the security vulnerabilities described in the paper for the programming languages: Java, C\# and Ruby, and a case study that demonstrates how the Java vulnerabilities can be used in attacks on two widely used servers, Jenkins deployed on Tomcat and JBoss.  It also includes a secure drop-in replacement for \texttt{ObjectInputStream} that mitigates attacks based on the described vulnerabilities and a DaCapo-based\cite{blackburn2006dacapo} benchmark to assess the overhead of the instrumentation that implements the contracts-based mitigation strategy.
  
\end{scope}

% ARTEFACT: section on the contents of the artefact (code, data, etc.)
\begin{content}
  The artefact package includes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Script, \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/run-java.sh}}, including source code for the Java vulnerabilities (SerialDOS, Pufferfish and Turtles all The Way down) in \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/java}}
  \item Script, \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/run-dotnet.sh}}, including source code for the C\# vulnerabilities (SerialDOS, Turtles all The Way Down) in \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/dotnet}}
    \item Script, \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/run-ruby.sh}}, including source code for the Ruby vulnerability (SerialDOS) in \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/ruby}}
  \item JBoss and Jenkins servers for the case study experiments in \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/case-study}}
  \item Scripts for the case study experiments: \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/case-study/run-jenkins.sh}} and \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/case-study/run-jboss.sh}}
  \item Secure replacement for \texttt{ObjectInputStream} that uses contracts-based instrumentation to mitigate the attacks in \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/mitigation/dyn}} and script to run the experiment: \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/mitigation/dyn/run-mitigation.sh}}
  \item DaCapo-based benchmark for the instrumentation that can be executed with the script, \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/mitigation/dyn/dacapo-benchmark.sh}}
    \item Detailed instructions for using the artefact in \texttt{\url{~/evilpickles/instructions.md}}

  \end{itemize}
   To simplify the setup for the experiments, we provide a VirtualBox disk
  image containing a Linux distribution fully configured for
  conducting the experiments. The image contains Ubuntu 16.04.1 server edition along with the source code and the JBoss and Jenkins configured for the case study experiments.

% ARTEFACT: section containing links to sites holding the
% latest version of the code/data, if any
\begin{getting}
% leave empty if the artefact is only available on the DROPS server.
% otherwise, provide links to the latest version of the artefact (e.g., on github)
  The latest version of our code is available on:

\end{getting} 

% ARTEFACT: section specifying the platforms on which the artefact is known to
% work, including requirements beyond the operating system such as large
% amounts of memory or many processor cores
\begin{platforms}
  The artefact is known to work on any platform running Oracle VirtualBox
  version~5 \\({\url {https://www.virtualbox.org/}}). The experiments were conducted on a host machine with 8GB RAM with a processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6300U CPU @ 2.40GHz

\end{platforms}

% uploaded to the Dagstuhl Research Online Publication Server, enabling 
% downloaders to check that the file is the expected version and suffered 
% no damage during download.
